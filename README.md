# MCP Proxy Hub

MCP Proxy Hub is a comprehensive solution for managing multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through a single unified endpoint. It allows AI assistants like Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-compatible tools to access a wide range of capabilities through a centralized proxy.

- **Single Endpoint**: Connect AI tools to dozens of MCP servers through one proxy
- **Web Dashboard**: Intuitive UI for managing MCP servers
- **Server Discovery**: Easily discover and install MCP servers from repositories
- **Process Management**: Start, stop, and monitor MCP server processes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: View logs and performance metrics
- **Docker Deployment**: Simple containerized deployment

## Why Use MCP Proxy Hub?

Managing multiple MCP servers with AI assistants typically requires configuring each server individually in every tool. MCP Proxy Hub eliminates this complexity by:

- Providing a single connection point for all AI tools
- Centralizing server management and configuration
- Simplifying discovery and installation of new capabilities
- Offering real-time monitoring and logs
- Standardizing deployment through Docker

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bacoco/mcp-proxy-hub.git
cd mcp-proxy-hub

# Start the container
docker-compose up -d

# Access the UI
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Configure in AI Tools

In Cursor IDE:
1. Open Settings > MCP Servers
2. Add a new server with URL `http://localhost:3008`

In Claude Desktop:
1. Open Settings > MCP Servers
2. Add a new server with URL `http://localhost:3008`

## Architecture

MCP Proxy Hub consists of several components:

- **Proxy Server**: Routes MCP requests to appropriate backend servers
- **Server Manager**: Handles server lifecycle and configuration
- **API Server**: Provides RESTful endpoints for management
- **Web UI**: React-based interface for configuration and monitoring
- **Database**: Stores server configurations and logs
