# UI Implementation

Create a React-based UI with the following components:

1. Core Components:
   - Dashboard: Main view with server status
   - ServerList: List of configured servers
   - ServerDetail: Configuration details for a server
   - ServerLogs: Log viewer for a specific server
   - DiscoveryBrowser: Interface for finding new servers

2. Layout:
   - Responsive design with Material-UI
   - Navigation with sidebar
   - Header with status indicators
   - Content area with main views

3. State Management:
   - Redux store with proper slices
   - Async thunks for API calls
   - Selectors for derived data
   - Action creators for UI events

4. API Integration:
   - Service layer for API calls
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Authentication handling
   - Error handling and retry logic

5. Features:
   - Server management (add, remove, configure)
   - Server control (start, stop)
   - Log viewing with filtering
   - Server discovery and installation
   - System status monitoring

The UI should be intuitive, responsive, and should provide real-time updates when server status changes.
