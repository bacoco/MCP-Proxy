# Database Implementation

Create a SQLite database layer with the following features:

1. Core Database Setup:
   - Initialize SQLite database with proper configuration
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add transaction support
   - Include schema migrations

2. Data Models:
   - ServerConfig: Store MCP server configurations
   - ServerLog: Store server logs
   - User: Store user credentials (if auth is implemented)
   - DiscoveryCache: Cache discovery results

3. Data Access Methods:
   - Create CRUD operations for all models
   - Implement query builders
   - Add filtering and pagination
   - Include proper error handling

4. Migrations:
   - Create initial schema migration
   - Add version tracking
   - Implement upgrade/downgrade paths
   - Include data validation

5. Performance Optimizations:
   - Add indices for common queries
   - Implement prepared statements
   - Add query caching where appropriate
   - Include performance monitoring

The database layer should be robust, handling concurrent access, and should include proper error handling for all operations.
