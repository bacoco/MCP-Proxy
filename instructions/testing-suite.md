# Testing Suite

Create a comprehensive testing suite with the following components:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Use mocks for dependencies
   - Cover all core functionality
   - Include edge cases and error handling

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test component interactions
   - Include database operations
   - Test API endpoints
   - Verify proxy functionality

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Test complete workflows
   - Include UI interactions
   - Verify Docker deployment
   - Test with real MCP servers

4. Test Utilities:
   - Mock MCP server for testing
   - Test fixtures and factories
   - Assertion helpers
   - Test database setup/teardown

5. Test Configuration:
   - Configure Jest for TypeScript
   - Set up test environment
   - Configure code coverage reporting
   - Add CI integration

The testing suite should be comprehensive, covering all critical functionality, and should provide clear feedback when tests fail.
