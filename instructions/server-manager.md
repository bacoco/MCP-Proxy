# Server Manager Implementation

Create a server management system with the following capabilities:

1. Server Lifecycle Management:
   - Start/stop MCP server processes
   - Monitor server health
   - Capture stdout/stderr output
   - Handle process termination gracefully

2. Configuration Management:
   - Store server configurations in SQLite
   - Support environment variable configuration
   - Handle command-line arguments
   - Support both local and remote servers

3. Server Discovery:
   - Fetch available MCP servers from repositories
   - Parse server metadata
   - Prepare installation instructions
   - Track updates to installed servers

4. Process Handling:
   - Use Node.js child_process for spawning
   - Implement proper signal handling
   - Add resource limitation options
   - Include timeout mechanisms

5. Logging:
   - Capture and store server logs
   - Implement log rotation
   - Support log filtering and searching
   - Add log level configuration

The server manager should be robust, handling edge cases like process crashes, and should provide detailed information about server status.
